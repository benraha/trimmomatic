# Trimmomatic
A clone of trimmomatic source code, Trimmomatic :  A flexible read trimming tool for Illumina NGS data

This code is mainly a dump of the code from http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic

version 0.38, with my minor changes.

I'm not the author of it, find contacts on the website
